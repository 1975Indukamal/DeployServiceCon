            Developing a dedicated web-based and mobile platform for salon
            booking requires a comprehensive understanding of user needs,
            technical requirements, and market trends. By following a structured
            development process and incorporating user feedback, we can create
            an app that meets our customers needs and drives engagement and
            loyalty.
